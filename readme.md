# **A rule-based tool for System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA)**

TO DO

## **Prerequisites**

For execution of all commands, it is necessary the use of [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## **Installation**

Open a bash/git bash to clone the repository

```
#!npm
git clone https://bitbucket.org/FellipeRey/stpatool
```


In stpatool folder, we need install Gulp, an automated task runner. Typing the command below, a new folder (node_modules) will be created with the content of Gulp.

```
#!npm
npm install -g gulp
```


To install the remaining dependencies, execute the command:

```
#!npm
npm install
```


Some Laravel folders (like vendor) do not change, so it is not necessary to send them to the repository, it can be obtained through the command:

```
#!composer
composer install
```



Gulp is the responsible to get all views, css, images and javascripts files(folder resources), compile them and send to the public folder.

```
#!composer
gulp
```

**Attention!**

1. Create a new .env file. Copy the content of .env.example and modify using your database configuration


2. Create a schema in your database named "stpatool"


3. To create all tables automatically, just type:



A new key must be generated for the new Laravel application. 

```
#!composer
php artisan key:generate
```


```
#!mysql

php artisan migrate --seed
```

## **Running the application**

After complete the Installation, you must open two bashes and execute the commands:

```
#!bash

php artisan serve
```
and
```
#!bash

gulp watch
```

**Attention! ** If no change in the resources folder, it is not necessary to run the second command (gulp watch)

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
