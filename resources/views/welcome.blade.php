                    The STPA Tool was created to provide an environment to safety analysists complete their STPA Analysis. To introduce beginner analysists on STPA technique (however, the tool can be used for experient analysts as well), the tool embraces two approaches: The first one is a rule-based approach developed by Gurgel et al. to help analysts to find unsafe control actions based on the analysis of all possible contexts (the approach assumes that the system can be modelled using variables). The second approach provides a list of generic scenarios, associated causal factors, requirements and rationale. The analyst can choose items of this list and add (and posterly, tailor them) them to his analysis.
